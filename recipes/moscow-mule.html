    <h2>About Moscow Mule</h2>
    <p>A Moscow mul is a cocktail that is made with vodka, ginger beer, lime juice
        lime, and mint.
    </p>
    <p>The Moscow mule was born out of the need to clear the bar's cellar. Wes Price, the creator, 
        needed to clear the basement of unsold inventory, which usually consisted of vodka and ginger beer.
